# pd2-set-fov-sensitivity

put "set FOV & Sensitivity" folder into the \PAYDAY 2\mods\ folder

edit set.lua with notepad++ or similar

change fov and sensitivity variables according to mouse-sensitivity.com

Alternatively calculate values on your own, m_yaw is 0.15, CS:GO is 0.022, OW is 0.0066. FOV is 65 4:3 horizontal.

If you want to manually set them then fov is a multiplier for 90 fov horizontal 4:3

Sensitivity scales from 0.3 being 0% on the in-game slider to 1.7 being 100% on the in-game slider. You can go outside these values if you wish.

In-game you need to set a mod hotkey in BLT's menus to run the script.
