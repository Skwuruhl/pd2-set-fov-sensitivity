# pd2-set-fov-sensitivity

put "set FOV & Sensitivity" folder into the \PAYDAY 2\mods\ folder

edit set.lua with notepad++ or similar

change fov and sensitivity variables according to www.mouse-sensitivity.com (manual instructions below)

In-game you need to set a mod hotkey in BLT's menus to run the script.

If you want to manually set them:

fov is a multiplier for 65 fov horizontal 4:3

Sensitivity scales from 0.3 being 0% on the in-game slider to 1.7 being 100% on the in-game slider. You can go outside these values if you wish. m_yaw is 0.15, CS:GO uses m_yaw 0.022, and OW 0.0066.

Basically multiply your CS:GO sensitivity by 0.1466.. or OW by 0.44
